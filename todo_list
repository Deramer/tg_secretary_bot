check the code on windows (after tables); (I wasn't able even to start python3... What?)
show messages from a specific user;
add good logging;
do smth with printing oserror101 exceptions, they are annoying;
do commits regularly.
? add marks to users, like ".mark" to quicker referring.

little tasks:
write a bot to determine father_id and bot_id;
rewrite stream and send so that they accept form "stream user".

improve code:
rewrite self.process_father_message using dictionaries, not the endless series of if statements.
